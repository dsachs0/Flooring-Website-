# Flooring-Website-

This is a static website that I created for a flooring business. It is a simple website that displays their services and contact information. I took on this project to help me learn the basics of front end web development. It is created with HTML, CSS, and a small amount of javascript.

Goal: The goal of this website is to provide a flooring company with an online presence in order to drive sales and expand the customer base. For me, the goal was to learn HTML, CSS, and how front end development works. 

Challenges: The biggest challenge when completing this project was understanding how CSS works. I understood the syntax and basics but CSS can be quite overwhelming to a beginner due to how much customization there is. I used the "box" method to visualize the styling and overcome this challenge. Additionally, I created cheat sheets to help me with the basic customizations. Overcoming this challenge has helped me understand website design better, which is crucial for any future website development that I do in the future.
